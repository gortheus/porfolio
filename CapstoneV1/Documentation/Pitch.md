Inspiration: Amnesia Game, Spooky's jumpscare mansion, Layers of Fear

# Pitch

### Logline
After loosing a relative, following their tracks leads you to a forrest. As you progress in your search, you come to the disturbing realization that this is no ordinary forrest.
### Mood
* Changes as a result of early game progression: somber $`\rightarrow`$ creepy/scary/dark and a hint of madness.

### Motivation
* To fill a void, not many scary games. Have a game that stands out in the market.
* To introduce new mechanics with react table that are not used in most games.

### Base Mechanic(s) / Genre(s)
* There will be blind spots where the 'haunted player' can reside and not be seen by the 'ghost player'. The 'haunted player' will have no indication of where these blind spots are; they'll have to figure out in what regions do the least strange things happen.
* Player: Running, walking, couch (to make less sound),  blink (to get the ghost to leave)   
* Enemy Player: moving obstacles, placing traps

### Differentiation / Input
* VR Game, where the 1st player is immersed, while the 2nd player manipulates the environment from the table.
* Game is essentially a 1v1 and each player's obstacle will be the limits of the game and the movements made by each player.

### Business
* Not many popular Horror games, so this game will stand up in the market.
* Although a VR headset is recommended, it can also be played without it.
