# Sprint Outlines

## Sprint I
#### Ideation
* Documentation: Finalize the Pitch
* Ideation: Propose technologies to enhance game experience.

#### Research
* Ideation: Research proposed technologies; how will their implementations impact the game?  

#### Design
* Design: design a couple of levels; how can the implementation of a technology enhance gameplay?
* Code: High level outline of game networking and outline of technology (include outline of classes).
* Documentation: Draft project plan (add what we can and know at the moment)

## Sprint II
#### Design
* Design levels with these in mind:
 - Do we directly manipulate objects in unreal from processing or use triggers in processing?
 - Do we have the ghost player be visible or a presence?

#### Code
* Implement code outline
 - Processing should be able to communicate with unreal
 - Reactivision should be implemented and able to be used to move objects in Unreal from Processing.
* To test:
 - Do we directly manipulate objects in unreal from processing or use triggers in processing?
 - Do we have the player be visible or a presence?   

#### Art
* Initial sketches
    - Multiple sketches per asset and level
    - Think of scalability in terms of level progression
        * What is the vision? How will art evolve to reflect the change in mood?
    - No refined sketches, just ideating on visuals
* Asset list
    - What are the main art assets that we're going to need? 
    - These will be prioritized in further development of art

## Sprint III
### Art
* Start thinking of the animations/style for the player(s)
* Begin initial work on modeling
* update the alpha assets into more presentable versions for a beta build
### Sound
* Start drafting sfx
* Start drafting tracks to enhance game atmosphere
### Code
* Polishing of the basic mechanics based on feedback from alpha testing
* Perfect communication between Processing and Unreal
* Strat thinking of how to incorporate art assets with collisions
* Work on chaining and scaling objectives of each level to have seamlessness
* Rethink any player design models (perhaps due to complexity)
* Focus on further importing details and visions from level design
### Misc. / Documentation
* Start thinking of what kind of shots should be saved and recorded for the behind the scenes/making of trailer for the game
* Save footage and screencaps of game development
* Think of what is going to be displayed on the website

## Sprint IV
### Code
* Bug testing and patching
* Rework game elements based on play testing feedback
* Revisit any mechanics initially left out and see if they can make a positive difference (time permitting)
### Art
* Polishing or reshaping art models and designs based on play testing feedback
### Sound
* Polishing of sound work in the game to better serve game atmosphere and match art assets and mechanical timings
### Documentation
* Make sure project plan/gdd is updated and up to the required standards
* Start planning out what kind of shots to take from the game for the main trailer
* Start uploading necessary media to website

## Sprint V
### Misc. / Documentation
* Cut up the trailers for the making of and main trailer
* Work towards finalizing gdd/project plan
* Complete website setup
### Code
* Keep rolling out necessary patches and reworks based on testing feedback
* Fine tune technology for as smooth as possible of use come Capstone
* Package the game without errors (solve errors that come up)
