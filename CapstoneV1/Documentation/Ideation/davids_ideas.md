1. _**Dino Game :**_ Facing extinction, a dinosaur has to traverse the dangerous environment as it crumbles underneath his feet:  
 * 3D game, whose world is situated on a chess board kind of ground
 * Could be a 2/1(?) player game
 * An external interface is used, it looks exactly like a chess board and comes with Tetris like pieces, these pieces will be placed on the board and be transformed into platforms in the game, which will help the player traverse the environment
 * When the player steps on the platforms they quickly disappear so the main player is prompted to react quickly and the other player to place a piece on the board to prevent them from falling. 
 * (maybe, but a long shot)using vr for the player controlling the character on screen, so they won't know where the other is placing the pieces.
2. ~~**self-destruct :**~~ A robot that becomes sentient tries to escape a forgotten, broken laboratory who's traps are still active and functioning
 * 2D game, desolate, uninhabited, scary feel(?)
 * player has to traverse levels with saws, lasers, and such
 * player can detonate whenever he wants, being able to de-activate _some_ traps (to prevent players from blowing too many things up and making the levels WAY too easy)
 * (possible) player dying also blows him up -> possibility of also destroying platforms that would've made the level easier
 * Some levels still possible without detonating, so if you are struggling, it is something that can help - some levels *will* require detonating however
 * beating the game with few detonations unlocks secret levels (as a reward for beating the game as it was intended)(or have to find another way of rewarding the players for beating the game without making it easier(or maybe slightly punish the players who self-destruct))
3. ~~_**dasher :**_~~ A long time in the future, humanity has deteriorated and the world is now run by sentient robots - your job in this world is as part of the resistance
 * 3D(?) top-down platformer
 * momentum based game can activate a dash to move quickly or cross gaps
 * levels have firing enemies and your player does not have weapons, only a shield that can be aimed towards enemies to reflect their bullets -> dash+shield will push enemies you crash against
 * Shield controlled by leap (motion controls) 
4. ~~**Batter :**~~ Kind of like dodgeball and pong, but you gotta hit the ball with the bat and if it hits you, your player takes damage
 * like smash bros but the ball bounces around the stage and turns your color, if it hits you and it's not your color you take damage and it bounces(or you die?)(or you get hit and the faster the ball is the further you fly, maybe like how percentages work in smash)
5. **splash :** intergalactic war against aliens trying to invade the earth
 * colored shield, that protects against different colored bullets being shot at you
6. ~~**Help :**~~ A game where if you yell loud enough into the mic you might get another life
7. **Beater :** A game where you are only allowed to move at the beat of the music, if you miss a beat or move at the wrong time you loose health
