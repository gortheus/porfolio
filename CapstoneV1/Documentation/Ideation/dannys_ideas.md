Ideas


_**4.Robots take over the world, and the humans have to fight back using old weapons(bows and stuff).**_
-3D VR

-3rd Person

-Shooter game

-Many levels can be added

_**5.Ghost takes over human body in order to seek revenge against the person who killed him/her.**_
This game would be a 3D game using the vr headset. The player would use basic movement such as:w,a,s, and d. In the first level, the player would play as the ghost while they are still alive. No matter what the player does they would end up dying. Then in the next level the player would play as the ghost, but he/she would be in someone else's body. The game would be first person, and the game would be more of an scavenging game. The first level would be based on hiding, but the second level would be based on looking.
