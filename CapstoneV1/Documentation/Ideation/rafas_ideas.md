# The Top Two
* ~~Explore the ocean in search of Poseidon's Trident in order to sell it for a lot of money.~~
  - 3D Adventure?
  - Game is played in VR with a game controller?
  - Possible use of AR to solve puzzles to find clues towards the location of the trident?
  - Think of AR as an extension of the game (to try and limit ballooning complexity)?
  - With AR being an extension, it could allow for two players to play together, one solves the puzzles in AR, other in-game with VR?

* Adventure throughout a world devoid of color and find the secret to restoring it.
  - 3D Adventure?
  - Possible use of VR?
  - Use of Leap motion to interact with world?
  - Using Leap to create gesture based mini games?
  - Heavily stylized game (VR would increase the level of immersion)?
