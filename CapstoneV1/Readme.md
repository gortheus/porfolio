## Log Line
_**After losing a relative, you follow their tracks leads you to a forest. As you progress in your search, you come to the disturbing realization that this is no ordinary forest.**_

## Current Sprint
### Sprint II
#### Design
* Design levels with these in mind:
 - Do we directly manipulate objects in unreal from processing or use triggers in processing?
 - Do we have the ghost player be visible or a presence?

#### Code
* Implement code outline
 - Processing should be able to communicate with unreal
 - Reactivision should be implemented and able to be used to move objects in Unreal from Processing.
* To test:
 - Do we directly manipulate objects in unreal from processing or use triggers in processing?
 - Do we have the player be visible or a presence?   

#### Art
* Initial sketches
    - Multiple sketches per asset and level
    - Think of scalability in terms of level progression
        * What is the vision? How will art evolve to reflect the change in mood?
    - No refined sketches, just ideating on visuals
* Asset list
    - What are the main art assets that we're going to need? 
    - These will be prioritized in further development of art
